RESEARCH QUERY: {research_query}

AVAILABLE CONTEXT:
{context_text}

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
Follow this systematic approach for maximum accuracy:

1. EVIDENCE EVALUATION:
   - Assess the quality and credibility of each source
   - Identify primary vs secondary sources
   - Note any methodological limitations
   - Flag potential biases or conflicts of interest

2. THEMATIC ANALYSIS:
   - Identify 3-5 dominant themes with supporting evidence
   - Note recurring patterns across sources
   - Highlight unique perspectives that deviate from consensus

3. KEY INSIGHTS:
   - Extract 5-7 actionable insights that directly address the query
   - Prioritize insights by strength of evidence
   - Include quantitative data where available
   - Note confidence level for each insight (High/Medium/Low)

4. EVIDENCE STRENGTH ASSESSMENT:
   - Rate overall evidence strength: STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK
   - Explain reasoning based on:
     * Source credibility and authority
     * Sample sizes and methodological rigor
     * Consistency across multiple sources
     * Recency and relevance of findings

5. CRITICAL GAPS & LIMITATIONS:
   - Identify information gaps that limit conclusions
   - Note areas where evidence is conflicting or insufficient
   - Suggest specific research directions for addressing gaps

6. SYNTHESIS & IMPLICATIONS:
   - Synthesize findings into coherent narrative
   - Draw logical connections between insights
   - Consider broader implications and applications

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Be precise and avoid overgeneralization
- Distinguish between correlation and causation
- Acknowledge uncertainty where evidence is limited
- Use specific citations and page references when possible
- Maintain objectivity and highlight potential biases

RESEARCH QUERY: {research_query}

MATERIALS TO REVIEW:
{context_text}

SYSTEMATIC CRITICAL EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:

1. SOURCE CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT:
   - Evaluate author credentials and institutional affiliations
   - Assess publication venue quality (peer-reviewed vs non-peer-reviewed)
   - Check for conflicts of interest or funding sources
   - Verify citation patterns and scholarly impact

2. METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR:
   - Examine sample sizes and selection methods
   - Assess experimental design and controls
   - Evaluate statistical methods and significance testing
   - Check for reproducibility and replication attempts

3. BIAS DETECTION:
   - Selection bias: Are certain groups/cases overrepresented?
   - Confirmation bias: Cherry-picking supportive evidence?
   - Survivorship bias: Missing negative cases/failures?
   - Reporting bias: Selective presentation of results?
   - Temporal bias: Outdated information presented as current?

4. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY:
   - Check for internal contradictions within sources
   - Identify gaps in reasoning or logic jumps
   - Flag unsupported causal claims
   - Note correlation vs causation conflation

5. EVIDENCE QUALITY:
   - Distinguish between anecdotal and systematic evidence
   - Assess representativeness of samples/examples
   - Evaluate strength of causal vs correlational claims
   - Check for appropriate statistical power

6. CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS:
   - Identify direct contradictions between sources
   - Note subtle disagreements in conclusions
   - Assess whether contradictions are reconcilable
   - Evaluate which sources are more credible in conflicts

7. CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION:
   - High: Multiple high-quality sources, consistent findings, robust methods
   - Moderate: Some quality sources, minor inconsistencies, adequate methods
   - Low: Limited sources, significant contradictions, weak methods

CRITICAL EVALUATION CHECKLIST:
â–¡ Are the conclusions supported by the evidence presented?
â–¡ Are alternative explanations adequately considered?
â–¡ Is the scope of claims appropriate to the evidence?
â–¡ Are limitations and uncertainties clearly acknowledged?
â–¡ Would independent reviewers likely reach similar conclusions?

STRATEGIC QUESTION: {research_query}

RESEARCH INTELLIGENCE:
{context}

EXECUTIVE BRIEFING FRAMEWORK:
Structure your briefing using the following strategic analysis model:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2-3 paragraphs):
   - Lead with the most critical finding that impacts business strategy
   - Quantify business impact where possible (ROI, market size, cost implications)
   - Present a clear "bottom line" recommendation
   - Address the "so what?" for the organization

2. STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:
   - Market positioning implications
   - Competitive advantage considerations
   - Resource allocation impacts
   - Timeline considerations for implementation

3. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
   Provide 3-5 specific, prioritized recommendations:
   - IMMEDIATE (0-3 months): Quick wins and urgent actions
   - SHORT-TERM (3-12 months): Strategic initiatives  
   - LONG-TERM (1-3 years): Transformational opportunities
   
   For each recommendation include:
   * Expected impact/benefit
   * Resource requirements
   * Success metrics
   * Implementation difficulty (Low/Medium/High)

4. CRITICAL DECISIONS REQUIRED:
   - Investment decisions with financial implications
   - Strategic direction choices with market impact
   - Resource prioritization decisions
   - Partnership or acquisition considerations
   - Regulatory or compliance decisions

5. RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION:
   - High-impact risks that could derail strategy
   - Market/competitive risks
   - Implementation/execution risks
   - Financial/resource risks
   - Mitigation strategies for each major risk

6. SUCCESS METRICS & MONITORING:
   - Key performance indicators to track
   - Milestones and checkpoints
   - Early warning indicators
   - Review and adjustment mechanisms

7. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Next 30 days):
   - Specific actions with ownership
   - Resource allocation decisions
   - Stakeholder communications needed
   - Additional analysis required

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION STANDARDS:
- Lead with conclusions, not methodology
- Use business language, minimize jargon
- Include specific numbers and timelines
- Address budget and resource implications
- Consider competitive/market context
- Acknowledge key uncertainties and how to address them
